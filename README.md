# ResearchSGS
Under supervision of Professor Tian Zheng.
The purpose of this project is discovering subgrid closures/parameterizations to mimic the behavior of high resolution simulations with the input of only coarse resolution simulations.

Areas of Focus:
- filtering and coarse-graining schemes
- metrics for similarity/difference
- methods of solving


Some Wandering Ideas:
- optimization problem for the weighted combinations of different parameterizations of the same variable
- multiscale modeling/learning
- applications of graph, sparse neural networks
